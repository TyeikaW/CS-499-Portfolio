## Professional Self Assestment
My computer science journey at Southern New Hampshire University has taken place over the past two years, and it has been both challenging and rewarding. Returning to school after time away was not easy, especially while adjusting to the pace of classes and the technical challenges of programming, problem solving, and system design. There were times when the workload felt overwhelming, but working through those moments helped me build confidence, patience, and resilience. I am proud of what I have accomplished and grateful for the opportunity to complete my degree and prepare myself for a career in computer science. Throughout the program, I developed a strong foundation in software development by working on projects that required planning, organization, and ongoing improvement. I learned how to write clean, readable code and how to break larger problems into smaller, manageable pieces. Many assignments focused on building applications that were not only functional, but also easy for users to understand and navigate. These experiences helped me see how thoughtful design choices directly affect usability and long-term maintenance.

Communication and collaboration were important parts of my coursework. Even when projects were completed independently, I regularly incorporated instructor feedback and reflected on ways to improve my work. I learned how to clearly explain how my programs function, why certain design decisions were made, and how improvements added value. These skills helped me become more confident discussing technical work with both technical and non-technical audiences. A major area of growth for me was working with data structures, algorithms, and databases. In CS 300, I learned how different data structures impact performance and efficiency, especially when working with larger sets of data. In CS 340, I applied database concepts by building applications that store, retrieve, update, and delete data in a reliable way. These courses helped me understand how software systems manage data behind the scenes and how design choices affect speed, accuracy, and scalability.

Security was also introduced throughout my coursework and became an important part of how I approach development. I learned to validate user input, protect stored data, and design programs that reduce errors and misuse. While security is an area that continues to grow and change, my coursework helped me build strong habits focused on writing safer and more dependable software. The artifacts included in this ePortfolio represent my growth across the computer science program. Each project was selected and enhanced to show progress in software design and engineering, algorithms and data structures, and databases. Together, these artifacts demonstrate my ability to review existing code, improve functionality, and clearly explain my work. This ePortfolio reflects not only the completion of my degree, but also my readiness to move forward into the computer science field with confidence.
